<h1 id="web-flashcard-tools">Web Flashcard Tools</h1>
<p>This project serves as an alternative to paid flashcard tools such as
creating tests(Can not name specific sites for legal reasons)</p>
<h2 id="instructions-for-use">Instructions for use</h2>
<h3 id="creating-sets">Creating Sets</h3>
<p>Sets must be created in plain text documents(.txt among others).
Front and back of cards must be separated by one of three separators.
These are:<br />
tab(\t), pipe(|), semicolon(;), colon(:), comma(,), space( )<br />
Each card must be placed on it’s own line.</p>
<p>A tag can be added at the top of the file to define a separator for
the file in the format of:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb1"><pre
class="sourceCode txt"><code class="sourceCode default"><span id="cb1-1"><a href="#cb1-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>#separator:&lt;name-of-separator&gt;</span></code></pre></div>
<p>If this is not done the files will be separated by the first valid
separator found on each line.</p>
<p>If you want to have a line ignored start the line with ‘#’ invalid
lines stating with a different character will trigger a error.</p>
<h3 id="uploading-files">Uploading Files</h3>
<p>On every feature page the top of the page will contain a button to
submit your set. If a set has bad formatting a large red error will
appear. <em>THIS ERROR WILL NOT DISAPPEAR UPON UPLOADING A VALID
SET.</em> When a valid set is uploaded a button to start the feature
will appear. <em>THIS BUTTON WILL NOT GO AWAY UPON UPLOADING A INVALID
SET</em>. Due to the errors and continue buttons not disappearing, it is
recommended to reload the page in between uploading a new set.</p>
<h3 id="mass-study-standard-flashcards">Mass Study (Standard
Flashcards)</h3>
<p>Mass Study works like regular index card flashcards. After uploading
a set a next card button will appear. The front of the card will appear
with a flip card button. This repeats for the entire set.</p>
